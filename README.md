# Hangman
This project is a simple, terminal-based hangman game for Bash, made entirely in C++.


## Credits for Wordlist
The credit for the wordlist used in this project belongs to [Mieliestronk](http://www.mieliestronk.com/wordlist.html); however, I would also like to credit [Tom25](https://github.com/Tom25), since I found the wordlist through his Python Hangman project.
