# Project Summary
This project is a simple, terminal-based Hangman game for Bash, made entirely in C++. It has a list of 58,000 unique words to choose from, many of which are quite obscure. In addition to the fact that you only have 6 guesses, this version of Hangman is meant to be difficult. Moreover, there are two game modes to choose from: normal and reverse. The names are quite telling; 'normal' is just standard Hangman, whereas the word is reversed when playing 'reversed'.

## Credits for Wordlist
The credit for the wordlist used in this project belongs to [Mieliestronk](http://www.mieliestronk.com/wordlist.html); however, I would also like to credit [Tom25](https://github.com/Tom25), since I found the wordlist through his Python Hangman project.
